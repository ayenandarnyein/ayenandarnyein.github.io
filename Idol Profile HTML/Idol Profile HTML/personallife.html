    <p>Kim Jong-kook is able to speak English in addition to his native Korean.</p>
    <p>Kim is the uncle of singer Soya. Kim is known to be good friends with Jang Hyuk, Cha Tae-hyun, Hong Kyung-min and Hong Kyung-in. The five are known as the "Dragon Brothers" because they were all born in 1976, the year of the dragon.</p>
    <p>On August 27, 2010, Kim received a lumbar microdiscectomy surgery to relieve a herniated disk. Kim's management company, 101 Entertainment stated, "Kim Jong-kook carried on with his daily activities without knowing that he had a ruptured disk. However, he did feel pain, but did not think much of it, and he endured his condition with painkillers while filming SBS Running Man.</p>
    <p>In January 2015, he was a guest on the popular talk show, Healing Camp, where he shed light on many personal controversies, including his choice to work as a public service worker instead of an active-duty soldier during his mandatory military enlistment, which was partly due to the aforementioned back issues.</p>
